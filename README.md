# Cat-and-Mouse-Game

## Project Description

"Cat and Mouse Game" is an online one-player versus computer game created to test the users ability to avoid the computers next move. The mouse (user) must collect all nine cheeses without landing on the same square as the cat (computer) to win. If the mouse is caught by the cat, then the mouse loses.

For the optimal experience, the game is best played in a Google Chrome web browser.

The game was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like to see a picture of cat or mouse displayed on the page.
- As a player, I would like the game to not just be completely random. I would like an aspect of skill such as moving the mouse one position up, down, left, or right in order to avoid the mouse.
